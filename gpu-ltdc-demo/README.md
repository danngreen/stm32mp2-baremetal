# GPU LTDC Demo — spinning cubes

This project combines the `gpu/` and display projects by rendering 12 (or more)
moving/spinning cubes at about 60fps onto a display. The number of cubes can be
increased in the source code. Sources are pulled from `gpu/` and one of the `ltdc-lvds/`, `ltdc-dsi/` or
`ltdc-rgb/` projects, depending on the board and `DISPLAY=` option (see below).

## Display target

Choose the display with `make BOARD=... DISPLAY=...`:

- `make BOARD=ev1 DISPLAY=lvds` or just `make BOARD=ev1`: 1024×600 LVDS display on the EV1, using the `ltdc-lvds/` project.
- `make BOARD=devboard DISPLAY=dsi` or just `make BOARD=devboard`: 720×1280 MIPI-DSI ILI9881C panel on the custom devboard, using `ltdc-dsi/`
- `make BOARD=devboard DISPLAY=rgb`: 720×720 parallel RGB panel on the custom devboard, using `ltdc-rgb/`

All cubes are rendered into one full-screen tiled render target with a shared
depth buffer, so the depth test resolves occlusion between them, though there 
is no collision detection and so cubes will pass through each other (but
z-depth will determine which one is seen). Each cube has a world position,
velocity, spin rate, and base hue (faces are shades of the base hue).

The display is double-buffered, and the refresh is interrupt-driven via an ltdc callback.

## Performance

Overall performance is excellent: we easily hit 60 fps with up to around 100 cubes.
At 12 cubes, render time is 4-6ms on the 1024x600 LVDS EV1 display at 60fps (~123px/us),
and 8-12ms on the 720x1280 MIPI DSI display at 57fps (92px/us), and 5-8ms on the 720x720 RGB
display at 54fps (79px/us). The longer render times per pixel on the devboard is
likely due the single DDR4 chip on the devboard vs dual DDR4 chips on the EV1. 


## Expected output

You should see color cubes spinning on the screen.

You can edit NCubes in main.cc to increase the cube count.

You also can compile with DDRPERF=1 to see some DDR/GPU stats:

```bash
make BOARD=... DISPLAY=... DDRPERF=1
```
